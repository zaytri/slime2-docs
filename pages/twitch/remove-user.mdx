# <Twitch size={36} /> Remove User Event

The user with the specified `userId` has been timed out or banned in chat.

[**Managed mode**](/functions/event#managed-mode) will automatically remove all rendered events related to that user for you when this event is encountered.

```typescript filename="Event Data"
type RemoveUserEvent = {
  type: 'remove-user'
  userId: string
  source: 'twitch'
}
```
